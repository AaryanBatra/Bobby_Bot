# Bobby_Bot
A bot that tweets a template of Sir Robert Bryson Hall II every 12 hours. 
This design was originally created by Stefan Bohacek(original project can be found here: https://botwiki.org/resource/tutorial/random-image-tweet/). I used this design, and added on to it by adding a custom token system so every image could have its own individual label.
